# BOTCHA

## Advanced CAPTCHA Detection with Machine Learning

This project implements an advanced CAPTCHA detection system using behavioral analysis and machine learning. The BOTCHA application is designed to ingest real-time user data such as keystrokes, cursor dynamics, and session tracking to identify bots and differentiate them from human users. The system includes invisible fields to trap bots and uses a dynamic GIF-based CAPTCHA challenge for additional verification when suspicious activity is detected.

## Disclaimer

The BOTCHA CAPTCHA Detection System is designed for educational and research purposes. It is not intended for use in critical security environments or as a replacement for comprehensive cybersecurity solutions. While the system enhances bot detection and user verification through behavioral analysis and machine learning, it should be used in conjunction with other security measures to ensure complete protection against malicious activities.

## Prerequisites:

## Software Requirements:
Python 3.x: Required for running the machine learning model and related scripts.
Node.js: For backend development and server-side scripting.
npm: Node package manager to install necessary dependencies.
React.js: For frontend development and creating the dynamic user interface.
PostgreSQL: A relational database for securely managing and querying user data.
## Libraries and Dependencies:
TensorFlow: For building and training the CAPTCHA detection model.
Scikit-Learn: For data preprocessing and evaluating the machine learning model.
NumPy: For handling numerical computations.
Express.js: To handle HTTP requests on the backend.
pg (PostgreSQL Client): To connect and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
## Datasets:
A dataset that includes real-time user interaction data such as keystrokes, cursor movement, and session duration for training the CAPTCHA detection model.
## Tools:
Google Colab (optional): For cloud-based training of machine learning models if local resources are limited.

## Usage:

Simplified Accessibility:
Simplifies UIDAI portals for all users, including those with limited digital skills. Enhanced

Security:
Adds an extra layer of security through a GIF challenge, efficiently filtering out bots while ensuring a smooth experience for genuine users. 

Advanced Bot Detection:
Uses hidden traps, behavioral analysis, andse ssion tracking to defend against unauthorized access. 

Data Protection:
Protect sensitive user data on portals with strong securtiy protocols
